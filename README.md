static/               # Static assets
```

---

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, try these steps:

```bash
# Clean and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
bun install

# Sync SvelteKit project
bun run prepare

# Clear build cache
rm -rf .svelte-kit
bun run prepare
```

### Common Issues

- **Port already in use**: Change the port with `--port` flag

  ```bash
  bun run dev -- --port 3000
  ```

- **TypeScript errors**: Make sure to run sync first
  ```bash
  bun run prepare
  ```
